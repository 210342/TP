## Introduction

Generally speaking, we can say that data processing is carried out through the execution of operations. From this point of view, we can divide the data into:

1. **Simple data** - in this case, the data can be processed by a single operation, it is one action as a result of which the value is referred to as one whole. For example, changing the sign of an int variable.
2. **Complex data** â€“ here the data is composed of components. Therefore, to operate on complex data we need a selector operation to select a component that is to be subject to an operation. The selection method is determined by the data type, e.g. index for arrays and field selection for class or structure.
3. **Structured data** - by design, the distinguishing feature is that individual data items in a structure are selected based on intentionally programmed relationships between items.

This section is focused on structural data. In object-oriented programming, the basic way to create structured data is to define custom classes and link them using references. Let's analyze this case using sample code in the context of intentionally programmed relationships between items. As an example consider the [IPerson][IPerson] and [ICDCatalog][ICDCatalog] interfaces. Now let's perform a graphical analysis of the code. They are abstract definitions but a reference between interfaces in the diagram could be distinguished.

Because the mentioned interfaces are abstract definitions, they must be implemented first to instantiate a graph of objects based on them. We will analyze a few different implementations of them. Despite the differences, they always represent the same structure built up using reference types.

## Graph of Objects - In-process Structural Data

The [Person][Person] and [CDCatalog][CDCatalog] classes are example implementations of them, which are defined in the [TestDataGenerator][TestDataGenerator] class. It is worth stressing here that it is a fully manual implementation. In the referred snippet, the [Person][Person] class contains a representation of a set of albums released by one author, so it has references to instances of the [CDCatalog][CDCatalog] type. This code snippet is included in the unit test project and used later to analyze the next use case of creating a similar structure but using a dedicated embedded tool this time.

Now, let's perform a graphical analysis of the presented code. We can see the same reference between classes in the diagram. This relationship is inherited from the interface definition. As a result, the concrete classes can be used to create structured data, i.e. a certain group of objects interconnected by references. This group is often called a graph.

This approach is dedicated to be used for modeling in-process data. At run-time, in-process data refers to data that occurs and is maintained within the boundaries of a single operating system process. At design time it must be formally described by types. This design activity may be recognized as data modeling. In the case of object-oriented programming, it delivers an object model, i.e. a group of interconnected types definitions. Unfortunately, by design maintained by the program in-process data is limited only to necessary or relevant for further processing data. Deployment of communication, archival, and user interface access to external data is also required. Continuing discussion on the main topic, namely external data management the main goal of this section is to continue this discussion in the context of structural data.

## External Repositories

In general, the data managed by external repositories can be grouped as follows:

- Bitstreams offered by the file system and network
- Data structures offered by database management systems

Topics related to the use of bitstreams have already been discussed and we will not return to them now. So let's go straight to discussing issues in the context of accessing external repositories managed structural data.

We already answered the question of what structured data is and how to process it as part of the process responsible for hosting our program. External data means that it is managed by an independent process. This process has two tasks: data sharing and data processing. This requires that it has allocated resources, such as processor, memory, files, network, etc. Consequently, we must talk about a database management system. An example is a relational database. In a relational database, data is processed using SQL. SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

Unlike files, a DBMS allows you to share data. This means that if we want to use the file we have to open it and as a result, it is locked for exclusive use by the modifying process. There is no such limitation for databases, but access to data is carried out using queries. Such queries can be handled sequentially ensuring data consistency.

There is a fundamental difference between operating on streaming and structured data managed by an external system:

- By design, streaming data is serialized and deserialized into local structured data as an entity stored in a file
- Access to external structured data is provided through queries that are carried out in the DBMS process, i.e. remotely, and data processing can take place both remotely and locally.

Usually, in the case of data sequences, for example, a sequence of records from a personal database, we process them iteratively, i.e. we repeat selected activities for each element of the sequence, starting from the first element up to the end of the sequence. The need to perform queries remotely via the DBMS forces the process to be divided into two stages:

- selection of data that meets a certain criterion
- processing only preselected data locally

In the case of external data repositories, we have no alternative to deploy this scenario. However, in practice, it also turned out that such an approach is a good scenario when operating on local in-process data gathered in the working memory.

## Internal Repositories

An alternative way to create in-process structured data is to use a dedicated editor that allows you to define data using a graphical interface.
