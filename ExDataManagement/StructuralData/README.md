# Structural Data Preface

Generally speaking, we can say that data processing is carried out through the execution of operations. From this point of view, we can divide the data into:

1. **Simple data** - in this case, the data can be processed by a single operation, it is one action as a result of which the value is referred to as one whole. For example, changing the sign of an int variable.
2. **Complex data** â€“ here the data is composed of components. Therefore, to operate on complex data we need a selector operation to select a component that is to be subject to an operation. The selection method is determined by the data type, e.g. index for arrays and field selection for class or structure.
3. **Structured data** - by design, the distinguishing feature is that individual data items in a structure are selected based on intentionally programmed relationships between items.

This section is focused on structural data. Let's analyze this case using sample code. An example is the [Person][Person] and [CDCatalog][CDCatalog] classes, which are defined in the [TestDataGenerator][TestDataGenerator] class. In the program code, we see that the [CDCatalog][CDCatalog] class has references to an object of the [Person][Person] class to represent information about the author of the CD. The [Person][Person] class, on the other hand, contains a representation of a set of albums released by one author, so it has references to objects of the [CDCatalog][CDCatalog] class. This code snippet is included in the unit testing project and will be used later to analyze the use cases of the LINQ expression.

Now let's perform a graphical analysis of the code. We can see the references between classes in the diagram. Therefore, structured data, i.e. a certain set of objects interconnected by references, is often called a graph.
