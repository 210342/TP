# Structural Data Preface

Generally speaking, we can say that data processing is carried out through the execution of operations. From this point of view, we can divide the data into:

1. **Simple data** - in this case, the data can be processed by a single operation, it is one action as a result of which the value is referred to as one whole. For example, changing the sign of an int variable.
2. **Complex data** â€“ here the data is composed of components. Therefore, to operate on complex data we need a selector operation to select a component that is to be subject to an operation. The selection method is determined by the data type, e.g. index for arrays and field selection for class or structure.
3. **Structured data** - by design, the distinguishing feature is that individual data items in a structure are selected based on intentionally programmed relationships between items.

This section is focused on structural data. Let's analyze this case using sample code. An example is the [IPerson][IPerson] and [ICDCatalog][ICDCatalog] interfaces. Now let's perform a graphical analysis of the code. We can see the a reference between interfaces in the diagram.

The mentioned interfaces are abstract definitions. To instantiate a graph of objects based on these definitions they have to be implemented first. We will analyze a few different implementations of them. In contrast, they always represent the same structure built up using reference types added to the [IPerson][IPerson] definition and mentioned in the following line:

``` CSharp
    IEnumerable<ICDCatalog> CDs { get; }
```

An example implementation of them is the [Person][Person] and [CDCatalog][CDCatalog] couple of classes, which are defined in the [TestDataGenerator][TestDataGenerator] class. It is worth stressing here that it is a fully manual implementation. In the referred snippet, the [Person][Person] class contains a representation of a set of albums released by one author, so it has references to instances of the [CDCatalog][CDCatalog] type. This code snippet is included in the unit test project and used later to analyze the next use case of creating a similar structure but this time using a dedicated embedded tool.

Now let's perform a graphical analysis of the presented code. We can see the same reference between classes in the diagram. This relationship between types is a result of the relationship between the interfaces and can be used to create structured data, i.e. a certain group of objects interconnected by references. This group is often called a graph.
