>[**DOI**](https://www.doi.org/hb.html): Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) are the backbone of the academic reference and metrics system. It is aimed at researchers who want to cite GitHub repositories in academic literature. Use the [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) System to resolve a DOI name.

### Goal

Turning today's students into tomorrow's advanced software developer and architectures.

### Content

Main purpose of this repository is to provide code examples for education purpose. The code examples address the following application domains

- [**External Data-Intensive Programming**](ExDataManagement/README.md) : process data management, i.e. those that are input or output for the business logic of the program.
- [**Adaptive Programming**](AdaptiveProgramming/README.md): language constructs, patterns, and frameworks used at the development and deployment stage with the goal to increase the adaptability of the software.

#### External Data-Intensive Programming (ExDM)

Computer science in general, and especially programming activities, is a field of knowledge that deals with automation of information processing. Programs can be recognized as a driving force of that automated behavior. To achieve information processing goals programs have to implement algorithms required by the application concerned. In other words, the programs describe how to process data, which represent information relevant to the application. Data management - apart from the implementation of the algorithms â€“ is, therefore, a key issue from the point of view of automation of the entire information processing and computer science in general.

The [ExDataManagement](ExDataManagement/README.md) folder collects examples that can serve as a certain pattern with the widest possible use addressing the mentioned above application domain. In order to ensure the practical context and provide sound examples, all topics are illustrated using the C# language and the MS Visual Studio design environment. The source code is available in this repository.

> **Note**: to open the code samples in the Visual studio double click the file `ExDataManagement.sln`.

#### Adaptive Programming (AP)

The adaptive programming is presented as a catalog of language constructs, patterns, and frameworks used at the development and deployment stage with the goal to increase the adaptability of the program against changing production environment in which it is executed.

The [AdaptiveProgramming](AdaptiveProgramming/README.md) folder collects examples that can serve as a certain pattern with the widest possible use addressing the mentioned above application domain. In order to ensure the practical context and provide sound examples, all topics are illustrated using the C# language and the MS Visual Studio design environment. The source code is available in this repository.

> **Note**: to open the code samples in the Visual studio double click the file `AdaptiveProgramming.sln`.

## How to cite the software and associated documentation files

To be compliant with the license of the repository the below copyright notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software and associated documentation files (the "Software").

In this section, you will learn how to cite the "Software" using the DOI number. A DOI number is a unique identifying number for the Software version. Because this repository has a DOI, use the DOI in your citation for the article or any derived work, like this:

> Mariusz Postol, csharp (C#) in Practice: [Target Part Name], `https://github.com/mpostol/TP`, [year]
DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.2578244](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2578244)

or

> Mariusz Postol, csharp (C#) in Practice: [Target Part Name], `https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI`, [year]
DOI: [http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2578244](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2578244).

Replace `year` with the current year and `Target Part Name` with the name (or names) of the files you are referring to.
