# 1. Inter Layer Communications

## 1.1. What is the problem? ‚úçüèª

- Control flow
  - run-time term - realization of the program by the computer - computerization
  - sequence of instruction execution
  - methods call sequence
  - call stack
  - behavior
  - algorithm implementation
- dependency relationship
  - design-time terms
  - top-down relationship - the layer above refers to the definitions available by the layer below.

## 1.2. Communication

1. We write code not just for the computer; also, for communicating with fellow programmers and ourselves in the future. The code becomes central to communication. Programmers spend most of their time reading code than writing it. Simplicity and Implicity play a significant role in understanding code.
2. means of sending or receiving information,
3. Communication is the act of giving, receiving, and sharing information - in other words, talking or writing, and listening or reading. 
4. to transmit information, thought, or feeling so that it is satisfactorily received or understood two sides failing to communicate with each other The computer communicates with peripheral equipment.
5. Layers must be interoperable - Interoperability is the ability of different systems, devices, applications or products to connect and communicate in a coordinated way, without effort from the end user.

## 1.3. Calling Method Provider Correct Sequence

## 1.4. Calling Method Provider Wrong Sequence

## 1.5. Callback

- delegates
- methods
- arguments
- anonymous function

## 1.6. Event Based

- events

## 1.7. Reactive programming

Reactive programming describes a design paradigm that relies on asynchronous programming logic to handle incoming updates. It allows the implementation of a mechanism for receiving push-based notifications. It allows for the implementation of the publisher/subscriber interoperability pattern.

## 1.8. Constructor Injection

Injection means assignment a reference to an unknown type.

## 1.9. Property Injection
